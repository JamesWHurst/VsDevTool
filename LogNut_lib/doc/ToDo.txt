Implement and test OutputPipes / email

Think about how to handle the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging and ILogger compatability
and whether to include ISimpleLogger
and ILoggingProvider
and ILognutLogger

Should I use LogLevel, or LogOutputLevel ?
-and what is that [EnumMember] attribute that's been commented-out?

Implement configuration-files as XML, JSON, or YAML (or all of these possibilities?)

Create a version of this for .NET Core, and for ASP.NET-Core

Publish this also as a Nuget package
