I may want to carefully consider whether to include those Nuget packages.
LogNut is intended to be includable on minimal, and embedded and not-connected systems.


Note that the enum-type LogLevel, here defined within Enumables.cs,
may potentially conflict with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel.
I have intentionally made the definition of LogLevel match that of Microsoft's.
