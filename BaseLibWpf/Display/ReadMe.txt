I want to add another type of display-box, wherein it occupies a fixed portion of the application's
screen, and messages are added to a scrolling list. This way, one need not be concerned about
one message appearing on top of another, nor blocking the program. 
And this would be nearer to what the Win10 or Mobile apps do.
